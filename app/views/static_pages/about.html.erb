Who We Are

Whip is a mission driven start-up organisation whose vision is to create the first UK civic engagement and participation platform. We are independent, non-partisan and for profit. 


Our Mission

Whips mission is to place Parliament in your hands - to make it easy for citizens to find out about the issues important to them and be able to influence their MPs. The void between the electorate and parliament is ever growing, however, we can close the gap though a rapport between the two. Whip offers a constructive way of getting your opinion to your MP, a platform for MP’s to engage with their electorate and a way to see if your MP is listening. We empower users with the tools to directly influence Parliament. 

What if every British citizen could see and understand the bills going through westminster ? What if every British citizen could express an opinion on this information ? What if every British citizen could see if their MP was listening to their opinions ? In other words, what if you could have Parliament in your hands. 

Our Moto

Engage - Educate - Empower.
We simply want to provide a platform where citizens can easily interact with Parliament utilising tools they use on a day to day basis e.g facebook/twitter. We want to provide information which is clear and accurate so users can make informed decisions. Last we want to provide you with tools to directly influence the the direction our country goes in.

FAQ’s

How do we break down Legislation ?
Our team of Politics graduates research and review bills which are currently going through Parliament. They break down the boring stuff and provide detailed answers for the following questions. Bills meaning ? Arguments for ? Arguments against ? Who does it impact ? Potential costs ?. All of our team follow our core values and work hard to provide a bi-partisan perspective.

How come not all Bills are on the platform ?
Our goal is to have as many bills on the site as possible. However due to variety of reasons many bills attempting to go through Westminster will fail at the first hurdle, for example, A bill may fail to receive enough traction within the house. It is thus our job to work out which bills are most likely to get voted on and seek out bills which should receive the exposure they deserve.
